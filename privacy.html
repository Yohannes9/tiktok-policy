Privacy Policy

This application uses the TikTok Content Posting API to allow users to publish videos to their own TikTok account.

No personal data is stored on our servers. All authentication is handled directly through TikTok OAuth. Access tokens are stored only inside the user’s local environment (n8n workflow) and are not sent to or stored by any third party.

We do not collect, store, or share user data. All data processing is performed solely for the purpose of enabling users to post their own content to TikTok.
